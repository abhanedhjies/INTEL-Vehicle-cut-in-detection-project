Vehicle Collision Warning System  This repository contains a real-time vehicle collision warning system using YOLOv8 for object detection, distance estimation, and time-to-collision calculation. It enhances driver safety by alerting potential collision risks based on detected vehicle proximity and speed.

Objectives:

Real-time Collision Detection: Implement a system capable of detecting vehicles in real-time using YOLOv8 object detection.

Distance Estimation: Calculate the distance of detected vehicles from the camera using focal length and known object width.

Collision Risk Assessment: Assess collision risk based on vehicle proximity to predefined distance thresholds.

Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation: Compute the time-to-collision metrics for vehicles approaching dangerous proximity levels.

Visual Warning System: Provide visual annotations and warnings on video streams to alert drivers of high collision risk scenarios.

Integration and Deployment: Prepare the system for integration into existing vehicle safety systems or standalone deployment scenarios.
